<h3 align="center">A passionate Software Developer</h3>


# üí´ About Me:
Hello! I‚Äôm your go-to enthusiast for all things C++, machine learning, and data visualization üñ•Ô∏è. My recent stint at MicroGenesis TechSoft allowed me to hone my programming chops with real-world applications, all while exploring the depths of full-stack development.  Having a robust foundation in programming (C, C++, Python, SQL) paired with front-end and back-end technologies (ReactJS, MongoDB), I thrive in environments that challenge my problem-solving abilities. My curiosity doesn't end here; I have a keen interest in data structures and OOPS, which are my playgrounds for creativity and innovation.  Beyond my tech-savvy side, I bring the same level of dedication and precision to fencing ü§∫. My journey in fencing has equipped me with discipline and resilience, winning several accolades at state and national levels. This unique combination of technical expertise and competitive sports has sculpted my ability to focus and deliver under pressure.  Are you navigating the complex world of data? Let‚Äôs connect and explore potential collaborations!  Feel free to check out my projects or drop me a message!
